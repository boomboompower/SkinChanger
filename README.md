### Why?
The SkinChanger mod created when many mods offered capes in their clients/mods as a perk for donating. Minecraft's EULA did not (and still doesn't) allow for mods/clients to profit from exclusive goods they've created in the game. Since mods with payable capes kept popping up, I decided to create SkinChanger; a free alternative to those mods. The mod initially created with only skins in mind, however soon it also grew to support cape modification due to popular demand. 

After two years of inactivity, I decided it was time for an overhaul. Which is what is happening. The next release will be a complete rewriting.

Featuring:
* A new UI focusing more on the player aspect
* More ways to get skins/capes (urls, local files)
* Compatibility with other mods
* Accessibility across different versions.

### Features
For skins: 
* Skin from file
* Skin from URL
* Skin from a player's name/UUID

For capes: 
* Cape from file
* Cape from a URL
* Cape from optifine
